## General

### Profiles

Each character has a profile that contains your settings, such as the options in Razor and your hotkeys.

!!! tip "Profile Location"
        Profiles are stored in the same location as `Razor.exe` under `.\Profiles\`. You can create a new profile, which will be based on the *default profile settings* (`default.xml`)

!!! tip "Multiple Profiles"
    It's **highly recommend** that have you have 1 profile per character. If you use the same profile among multiple characters while logged in, you could potentially lose changes to your profile. It's doable, but requires an extra bit a caution to ensure you keep all your profiles synced up.

|Feature|Description|
|----|----|
|New|Create a new profile based off of the default Razor profile.|
|Save|Save all the current Razor settings without having to log out.|
|Clone|Clone the existing selected profile and create a new one.|
|Delete|Delete the selected profile.|

#### Creating a new profile

Clicking **New** will generate a new profile based on the default profile that comes with Razor. If you rather create a new profile using an existing profile, select that profile first and click the **Clone** button.

#### Saving your profiles

Razor will save your profile two ways.

* When you open your paperdoll in UO, click **Logout** and click **OK**.
    * This triggers the client to tell Razor that you logged off, which performs the profile save.
* Click the **Save** button manually to ensure your changes are saved.

### Maps / Boat

#### UOPS

Razor's Ultima Online Position System (UOPS) gives you a basic map.

#### Boat Control

**Boat Control** was inspired by UO Rudder and designed to make navigating the seas of Britannia much easier. This tool is built into Razor.

!!! tip
    Right-clicking on 1 of the 4 directions will set relative location.
