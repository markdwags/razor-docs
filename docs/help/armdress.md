This is the list of arm/dresses can consist of a complete outfit or just one item. Hotkeys can be assigned to each. Use the **Add** and **Remove** buttons to manage.

* **Automatically move conflicting items**
    - Check this box so Razor can dress you properly. This allows items to be removed when neccesary. For example, you are equiped with a halberd and hit your hotkey to equip a war axe. With this box checked, Razor can un-equip the halberd to equip the war axe. This will apply to all lists and hotkeys.

## Arm/Dress Items

This is where you define the items for each list created above. Highlight a list from the left and use the following tabs to set it up. Any entries can be right-clicked for conversion to 'Dress by Type'.

>> ***Note:** 'Dress by type' will tell Razor to look for any item of that type to use, not only the specific item used to set the list. This is most useful for weapons.*
