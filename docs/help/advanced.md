This tab will show some data regarding Razor internals and give you a few options. The data on the left is purely for informational purposes only.

## Options

|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|Open Data Directory|Opens Windows Explorer to the folder containing your profiles and macros.|
|Enable packet logging|This feature will save all packets flowing between the UO client and server. Useful for debugging purposes but when enabled can slow down Razor and eventually cause a large file to be created if not disabled.|
|Negotiate features with server|This allows Razor to communicate with the server to enable/disable certain features in Razor. When this box is not checked, Razor will fail to respond to a negotiation packet and you will subsequently be disconnected from the server you are connected to.|
|Enable UOA API|This opens up a limited API that can be used by 3rd party applications (such as various mapping tools) to get some data from Razor.|

## Disable SmartCPU

SmartCPU has been completely removed from this version, but the option to disable it remains in place in case it was enabled in an older version.

## Backup

To create a backup, click the `Create Backup` button. This will copy all your profiles, macros and scripts to the `Backups` folder in the root of your Razor folder.
